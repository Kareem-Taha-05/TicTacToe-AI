## Project Overview
This project is part of CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. The task was to implement a **Tic-Tac-Toe AI** using the **MiniMax algorithm**. The provided starter code included a basic game setup, and my task was to complete the AI logic using the MiniMax decision-making algorithm.

### What I Implemented:
- The **MiniMax algorithm** to enable the AI to make optimal moves in Tic-Tac-Toe.

### What Was Provided:
- A basic framework for the game, including the board, player functionality, and a partially implemented AI.

This project helped me understand the importance of recursive algorithms and how to make optimal decisions in turn-based games.
